# Ormius
Simple lightweight Orm for mysql.

At this point it is a work in progress, it is not yet stable!

There is a lot of orm written for nodejs out there, so why one more? Because I can.
Orm like prisma or sequelize are at this point better to use (If you read this and you want to help come chat!).

This library exist because I wanted to see if I was able to build something like this, and also because I come from rails, and I wanted to build something as easy to use as active record.

At this point, ormius support only mysql.

This repository contains an example project using Ormius, a cli to manage the database/the models and the core code.
